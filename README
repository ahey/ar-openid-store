ar_openid_store
===============

An ActiveRecord-based OpenID store for the ruby-openid gem.  This gem itself is based on the active_record_openid_store included in the examples of the ruby-openid gem by JanRail (see NOTICE).  I've just packaged it
as a gem for convience and use outside of Rails.

To install:

  gem install ar_openid_store
  
To create the tables.  Create a migration similar to the following:

  require 'ar_openid_store/migration'
  class AddOpenidTables < ActiveRecord::Migration
  
    def self.up
      create_openid_tables
    end
    
    def self.down
      drop_openid_tables
    end
    
  end
  
To use with merb_openid:

  Merb::Config[:merb_openid][:store] = ActiveRecordStore.new
